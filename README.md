# Cookiecutter ansible molecule template role

Created a new ansible role via a cookiecutter template role:

``` bash
$ cookiecutter https://<git_server_url>/<repository_name>.git
You have downloaded /<home_directory>/.cookiecutters/molecule before. Is it okay to delete and re-download it?
[yes]: yes
role_name [OVERRIDEN]: <role_name example: role_example_name>
scenario_name [default]: <enter>
```

> **note** `cookiecutter` is bundled with [ansible molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
